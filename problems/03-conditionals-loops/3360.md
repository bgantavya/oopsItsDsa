# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
if you observe clearly we are playing with two variables here
one is n i.e. the no. of stones for game;
and second i i.e, the no. of stones player x has to pick up
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
we can observe that if player x has to pick 2a stones(even)
as similar player y has to pickup 2a-1 stones(odd) 
everytime of their chance ranging one less than what other player drawn if not possible it's a lose.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []

import java.util.Scanner;
class Solution {
    public static boolean canAliceWin(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int i = 10;
        while(true){
            if(n<i) break;
            n-=i;
            i--;
            count++;
        }
        return (count%2==0) ? false : true;
    }
}

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
question asks us to do procuct - sum of its numbers(in n)

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
so if we look thoroughly it wants the user to break a number into digits via treating remainder and then dividing number by 10

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []
import java.util.Scanner;
class Solution {
    public static int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;
        while(n>0){
            sum += n%10;
            product *= n%10;
            n/=10;

        }
        return product - sum;
    }
}
```
```python []

        sum = 0
        pro = 1
        for i in str(n):
            sum+=int(i)
            pro*=int(i)
        return pro - sum

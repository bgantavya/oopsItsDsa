# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
we have different clients and have to find the richest person in all those

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
considering we have a array, 
(its not dynamic) just a simple 2D Array of length m*n 
where m are the clients
and n are number of wealth client has in each of its multiple account portfolio
so we have to just find out the total wealth of each client and return just the wealth of the richest one

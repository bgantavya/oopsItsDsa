[
    1773. Count Items Matching a Rule
You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
lovely question and so easyone to start the day with as
written in simple language and no hidden constraint making chance of wrong error
Well I did it in C, Java, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript etc. to make foundation strong in every language


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
approach is real 
lets keep a track with key, 
we will do what key number is, and assign a value to it
then will do the iteration in array items if any item in array has
its value at index key equal to ruleValue we count it
at last we will return all count of incremented variable


# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []

        int key = 2;
        if (ruleKey.equals("type")) key = 0;
        else if (ruleKey.equals("color")) key = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for(List item : items) if(item.get(key).equals(ruleValue)) count++;
        return count;
    }

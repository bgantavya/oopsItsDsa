<!-- Problem statement with number here -->
[ 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
what question wants you to do is find the kid with highest candies, save it.
then if you provide your extraCandies to ith kid, will he be able to replace the kid with highest candies, if yes return true else false
and save all this data in an boolean array and return simple!

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
learnt two imp points today:
- until you dont need storage, dont create it.
- one line conditionals can increase time complaxity a little
- writing bigger codes isnt bad, if they are understandable, maintainable, and optimized

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        int high = candies[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < candies.length; i++){
            if(high < candies[i]) high = candies[i];
        }
        List<Boolean> results = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++){
            if(high <= candies[i] + extraCandies) results.add(true);
            else results.add(false);
        }
        return results;


    }

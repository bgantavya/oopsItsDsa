# Problem
[1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

--- 

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
If we look of what question is saying we will see that it want you to just set the value of element nums[i] to sum of nums[0...i] where i is an element of array nums with length n and datatype integer

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
To do this we will use a loop to do repetetive task followed by creating a sum variable initialised as value 0, now we will reassign value of sum everytime in loop as sum + present element initally staring from 0 and moving to -> n and assign the answer to the elemnt at index i and will keep on doing it then just return the array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {

        //  my intuition
        // int sum = 0;
        // for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        //     sum += nums[i];
        //     nums[i] = sum;
        // }

        // optimization
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            nums[i] += nums[i-1];
        }

        return nums;
    }
}
```
```python []
class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(1,len(nums)): nums[i] += nums[i-1]
        return nums
```

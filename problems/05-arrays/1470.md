    1470. Shuffle the Array
Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].
Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-the-array/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Intuition is saying that just have to have to arrays, whose elemnts could be arranged alternatively

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
if we see its a repetition so we can use loop starting from index 0 and considering the nums array as make up of two arrays lets loop the second array elemnts with it via n+i and limit of loop to be n
now we will just insert these elements as shown

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int[] shuffle(int[] nums, int n) {
        int x = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[x];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            ans[2*i] = nums[i];
            ans[(2*i)+1] = nums[i+n];
        }
        return ans;
    
    }
}
```

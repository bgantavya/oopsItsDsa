    1732. Find the Highest Altitude
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
considering from where rider start is the normal i.e. altitude 0 with respect to rider then as movements happen

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
lets assume you are a rider travelling in valley and all highs and lows are given as integers in array
we start the bike and vrooooom
vrooom start iteration in array `currentAltitude(Updated) = currentAltitude +(-) newAltitude`
and keep updating the highest altitude visited via max function of a condition and atlast 
`return highest altitude`

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

```java []

            alt += g;
            high = Math.max(high,alt);

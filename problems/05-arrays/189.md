# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
one approach that i though was of brute force way,
using loop that runs `k` number of times,storing `i-1`th elementin temp var shifting all elements by 1 and 
restroring temp var value in `0`th index value
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
what about mentos approach huh?
storing the `k` no. of elements from last in a temp array,
then shifting the `n-k` elements from start to last in sync
then restoring temp arr values from `0`th index

# Code
```java []

    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k%n;
        int a = n-k;
        int[] temp = new int[k];
        for(int i = a; i < n; i++) temp[i-a] = nums[i];
        for(int i = a-1; i >= 0; i--) nums[k+i] = nums[i];
        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) nums[i] = temp[i];
    }
